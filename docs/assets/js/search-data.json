Modules are anything that encapsulate logic with software. They cover everything enmerated in `module.schema`. \n\nDendron uses the schema to describe all of the [packages](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/32cdd4aa-d9f6-4582-8d0c-07f64a00299b.html#summary) it its monorepo. \n\nThe module schema is meant to be used as part of other schemas. For example, in the template vault, it is used in both `pkg.schema` and `service.schema`. This is because both packages (eg. React, NextJS, etc) and services (eg. AWS S3, Github, Stripe, etc) share the same underlying structure (eg. quickstart, concepts, architecture, lifecycles, etc)\n\n## Nodes\n\n### quickstart\n\nHow to get started as a user of the given module\n\n### concepts\n\n### concepts\n- example: [[Concepts|dendron.concepts]]\n\nAny terms or concepts we should understand\n\n### architecture\n- alias: arch\n\nThis goes over the general architecture.\n\nThis should include:\n- [ ] mermaid diagram of major lifecylce events (eg. startup, shutdown, main feature) and components\n- [ ] paragraph about major lifecycle events and components\n\nAn archietcture node can have children if it exceeds 800 words. At that point, every lifecycle/component can be a direct child \n\n### dev\n\nThis goes into specifics of the development process\n\n#### quickstart\n\nThis goes into how to get started developing this module\n\n- Sections:\n  - Pre-Req: what is needed before you start\n  - Steps: How to setup the project for development\n\n### faq\n\nAny commonly asked questions can be put here\n\n### ops\n- example: [[Ops|pkg.dendron-plugin.ops]]\n\nHow do we diagnose problems with this module.\n\n### qa\n\nHow do we maintain quality assurance on this module\n\n#### test\n\nHow do we functionally test that everything is correct\n\n#### performance\n\nHow do we test that the performance is sufficient?\n\n### quickstart\n- example: [[Quickstart|pkg.dendron-plugin.quickstart]]\n\nHow do we get started
